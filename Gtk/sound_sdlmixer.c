/*
 * REALLY GROSS HACK:
 * 
 * To mix sounds from several sources together, SDL_mixer first has to
 * convert them all to the audio device's expected format. Unfortunately the
 * frequency converter is atrociously bad. It can only multiply or divide
 * the source data's frequency by 2, until it reaches something it believes
 * is close enough.
 *
 * So we basically have to know the sample frequency of the MP3:s, or it will
 * sound horrible. Yuck!
 *
 * There are plans to rewrite SDL_mixer to fix this, and also remove the
 * somewhat artificial distinction between sound and music, but at the time
 * of writing this work has not yet begun.
