 * I have received confirmation that there a deadlocking bug was introduced
 * in XMMS 1.2.6 which causes the following line to hang:
 *
 *     xmms_remote_playlist (xmms_session, playlist, length, FALSE);
 *
 * Fortunately this code, which should have the exact same effect, will work
 * around the bug:
 *
 *     xmms_remote_playlist_clear (xmms_session);
 *     xmms_remote_playlist (xmms_session, playlist, length, TRUE);
 *     xmms_remote_play (xmms_session);
 *
 * The bug will supposedly be fixed in XMMS 1.2.8.
