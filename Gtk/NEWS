2005-08-XX - 1.6 (The "Syncing feeling" release.)

Re-sync with GtkLevel9 1.3:

Bugfixes

- Don't assume that "/" is the directory separator when building the
  config filename.

Other changes

- Usability updates for the file selector dialog: It always has a
  default widget, and it remembers which directory was used the last
  time.

2005-07-29 - 1.5 (The "To err is human (but it feels divine)" release.)

Bugfixes

- Minor fixes to the file chooser dialog.

Other changes

- We used to execute only one game instruction every time the program
  was idle, but it's probably more efficient (and not noticeable to the
  user) to run several. Now we run up to 20.

2005-07-28 - 1.4 (The "Modern Times" release.)

This release was prompted by the number of changes I made while
adapting the GtkMagnetic source code to create a GTK+ GUI for the
Level 9 interpreter.

Bugfixes

- This time there shouldn't be any remaining editable portion around
  old inputs. I hope.

Other changes

- GtkMagnetic was originally developed for GTK+ 2.0. A lot has
  happened since then. Specifically, a lot of things I used have been
  declared obsolete. One of the criteras for this release has been
  that GtkMagnetic must build without warnings on my system, even with
  all deprecated APIs disabled.

  + gtk_idle_add        -> g_idle_add
  + gtk_idle_remove     -> g_source_remove
  + gtk_timeout_add     -> g_timeout_add
  + gtk_timeout_remove  -> g_source_remove
  + GtkFileSelection    -> GtkFileChooser
  + GtkFontSelection    -> GtkFontButton
  + GtkOptionMenu       -> GtkComboBox
  + GtkItemFactory      -> GtkUIManager
  +                        GtkColorButton
  +                        GtkAboutDialog

  The transition to GtkUIManager means the "Help" menu is no longer
  right-justified. According to the GTK+ documentation, it "is now
  considered a bad idea".

  GtkMagnetic now requires GTK+ 2.6 or later. Since it was released
  more than six months ago, that does not seem unreasonable to me.

- Finally implemented a limit on how many lines the text buffer may
  contain. This is not the same as the number of lines in the text
  view: a text buffer line may be broken into several lines, so it's
  actually more like the number of paragraphs. This distinction will
  probably confuse the average user, so I have not made it
  configurable.

- Since the font selection has changed from a bulky font selection
  widget to a small font selection button, I've added another one to
  make the statusline font configureaable.

- Each colour setting now has a corresponding "override" checkbox, so
  that we can easily revert to the original GTK+ colours.

- Ugly hack to make the cursor and text the same colour.

2005-02-11 - 1.3 (The "Now you see it, now you don't!" release.)

Other changes

- Added a new text tag, "magnetic-input-padding" which is used for the
  extra spaces that are inserted in the text buffer to keep the
  editable area from vanishing. It uses the "invisible" attribute,
  which apparently isn't fully supported by GTK+ yet. Still, it seems
  to work well enough for my purposes.

2003-05-06 - 1.2 (The "Someone else actually uses this?!" release.)

Bugfixes

- Applied a patch from Bernhard B to fix the hints window that broke
  between 2.1 and 2.2.

2003-03-20 - 1.1 (The "Don't mention the war!" release.)

Other changes

- Updated for Magnetic 2.2

2002-07-08 - 1.0 (The "Plugging the leaks" release.)

Bugfixes

- When opening a new game file, a mysterious extra space would appear
  at the first input prompt. This has been fixed.
- Fixed bug which kept images from being scaled to constant height if
  the image scaler for non-constant height was 1.0.
- Fixed memory leak when freeing animated images.
- Fixed splash screen memory leaks.
- Fixed hints filename memory leak.
- Fixed hints window memory leak?
- Fixed file handle leaks.
- The check for modifier keys was a bit too strict. I only meant to
  only block stuff like Shift and Control, not Caps Lock and Num Lock!
- When retrieving a command from the history, make sure to scroll the
  command prompt into view.

Oher changes

- The text buffer/view signal handlers are now merely blocked and
  unblocked during gameplay, rather than torn down and recreated. It
  seemed marginally more elegant to do it this way.
- It is now possible to turn off the animations completely.
- Removed support for Magnetic 2.0 since 2.1 has been released now.

2002-06-21 - 1.0 rc 2 (The "Robin Goodfellow" release.)

Bugfixes

- Playing back a special command no longer appears as an empty string
  to a Magnetic Windows game. This fixes prompt weirdness.
- Make sure the last line of a game transcript ends with a line break.
- Fixed so that when making a transcript of a playback, each command
  is only written to the transcript file once, not twice.

Other changes

- At every new input prompt except for the first one, attempt to
  scroll the text view so that the previous input prompt is still
  visible. It's not quite as good as a "more" prompt, but it will have
  to do for now. Removed a few other attempts at scrolling the view
  since they had little or no effect.
- Added primitive word-wrapping of transcript files. So far, there is
  no way of configuring maximum line length, nor does it break lines
  at hyphens.
- Hints windows are now non-modal, since it's easier to use the hints
  if you can actually type while reading them. I didn't bother to put
  back the "Close" that the old one had. It should be obvious how to
  close the window anyway!
- Added an SDL_mixer sound backend. I don't really like it, because
  it's basically the same as the SMPEG one but with an extra library
  dependency and a gross hack, but it's so simple to write one that I
  couldn't just ignore it.
- Clarified the message for config file mismatch, hopefully making it
  a bit less scary.
- You can now tell GtkMagnetic to scale all images to a constant
  height, rather than using a constant scale factor. Of course, this
  may cause some images, e.g. the Dumb Waiter in Wonderland, to look
  extremely pixellated.

2002-06-19 - 1.0 rc 1 (The "Dead Code Society" release.)

Bugfixes

- Fixed an input bug introduced in the previous version.
- start_scripting() checked if record_file was open rather than
  script_file. Oops...

Other changes

- Major cleanups, primarily of graphics.c and text.c.
- Made the config file parser a bit stricter. Now it actually checks
  for the <configuration> tag and its version attribute.
- Allow #SEED to be used without argument so that the replay scripts
  included with the Magnetic source code should work without
  modifications. (Actually some of the scripts still don't work, but I
  don't think it's because of me.)
- Made generic functions for starting/stopping scripting, recording,
  and playback.
- text_insert() and file_selector() now take a format string and an
  arbitrary number of arguments, just like printf().
- I decided that it was silly to exclude special commands from
  recordings. They no longer are.
- The signal handlers to detect when the user inserts/deletes text or
  presses any "special" key are now only connected while waiting for
  user input. The actual behaviour is unchanged since they all used to
  check this explicitly.
- The text view's keypress handler now ignores stuff like Ctrl-ENTER
  and Shift-UpArrow.
- Removed the #REPLAY OFF hack. It's still a special command, but it's
  no longer needed to terminate playbacks.

2002-06-14 - 1.0 beta 4 (The "Unicode this!" release.)

Bugfixes

- Show the correct Magnetic core version in the About window.
- Deal more gracefully with non-ASCII characters in user input. Now
  they're discarded because the Magnetic core appears to be unable to
  handle them, but at least they're treated as single characters now,
  even if they occupied several bytes in the original string.
- More prototype fixes. I've guarded about future screw-ups by always
  including (sometimes otherwise unnecessarily) the appropriate header
  file into the file which defines the function.

Other changes

- Finally figured out how to encode my own name as UTF-8 for the about
  window. :-)
- Let ms_getchar() return 1 (instead of '\n') if there is no input
  buffer. This probably only happens when starting a new game while an
  old one is already running.

2002-06-10 - 1.0 beta 3 (The "Brown paper bag" release.)

Bugfixes

- Fixed incorrect prototype for and usage of start_new_game()
- Remembered to change version number

Other changes

- Minor cleanups

2002-06-09 - 1.0 beta 2 (The "Special Edition" release.)

Features

- Support for external hint files. This only works with Magnetic 2.1
  or later, which may or may not have been released by the time you
  read this.

Bugfixes

- Using the config dialog would restore the window partition to an
  older setting.
- Check for EOF during replay, not just zero-length lines.

Other changes

- The layout of the configuraion file has changed slightly, without
  any attempt to maintain backwards compatibility. Fortunately it
  should only affect the window size and partition settings. I'm sorry
  about this, but it's better to do this sort of things while it's
  still a beta version.
- It wasn't really my intention, but a large part of the old README
  consisted of a section on GtkMagnetic vs gMagnetic, and I still went
  on to ramble about other things. The main part of that section is
  now "Performance considerations". (Though there are still a few jabs
  at gMagnetic there. :-)
- And, of course, a few insignificant cleanups.

2002-06-06 - 1.0 beta 1 (The "It's alive!" release.)

First version where all the major features are present.
