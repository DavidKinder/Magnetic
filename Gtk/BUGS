* Setting the text background to black doesn't work very well, because
  the cursor remains black. See GTK+ bugs #79585 and #83192. Possibly
  others as well.

  There is a "cursor-color" property in GtkWidget, but apparently
  that's intended for themes.

* I've seen occasional colour corruption in GTK+ widgets. Apparently
  this is an XFree86 bug in the Matrox driver. If you are having these
  problems, try adding this to the "Screen" section of your
  XF86Config-4 file:

    Option "XaaNoOffscreenPixmaps"

  I've also heard rumors that it won't happen in XFree86 4.2.0.

* On some occasions I've seen GtkMagnetic start with the wrong font.
  It seems it has quite different ideas about what fonts are available
  when anti-aliasing is active compared to when it's not. Perhaps
  that's what's causing it...

* If GtkMagnetic pops up a modal dialog while the mouse pointer is
  obscured, it will still be obscured if you move it over the text
  view. Probably a GTK+ bug, but I haven't yet received any comments
  on my bug report.

* If Jinxter hangs if you try to GIVE TIN TO BAKER, then try taking
  the bread out and give him that instead. I don't know if this is a
  bug in Magnetic, or in the version of Jinxter I was playing.

* In some cases, when a second window (hints, file selector, etc.) is
  opened or resized, focus will flicker back and forth between the
  windows for a second or so. I have absolutely no idea what's
  happening here.
