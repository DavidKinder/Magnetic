<h1>MS-DOS Story Files</h1>
Story files can be created by extracting the data from both the original MS-DOS releases and the
later "Magnetic Windows" releases of "Wonderland" and "The Magnetic Scrolls Collection, Volume 1".
The latter of these comprised new versions of "The Guild of Thieves", "Corruption" and "Fish!".
<p>
To convert these files to the interpreter's own format the <b>XtractPC</b> (for the original releases)
or <b>XtractMW</b> (for the "Magnetic Windows" releases) programs, which are included with this interpreter,
must be used. <b>XtractPC</b> and <b>XtractMW</b> are Win32 console programs, so must be run from an MS-DOS prompt
under Windows. Run <b>XtractPC</b> or <b>XtractMW</b> without any arguments to read a help screen.
<p>
The syntax for <b>XtractPC</b> is:
<pre>
    XtractPC game game.mag
</pre>
where "game" is the full path to the data files, minus any trailing numbers. For example, the data
files for "The Pawn" are called "pawn1" to "pawn6". If these files are in a directory
"c:\Games\Magnetic\Pawn", the command line might be:
<pre>
    XtractPC c:\Games\Magnetic\Pawn\pawn Pawn.mag
</pre>
The syntax for <b>XtractMW</b> is:
<pre>
    XtractMW game.rdf game.mag
</pre>
where "game.rdf" is the full path to the game’s main rdf file ("all.rdf" for "Wonderland"; "corr.rdf",
"fish.rdf" and "guild.rdf" for the games in "Collection Volume 1"). For example, for "Wonderland", the
command line might be:
<pre>
    XtractMW c:\Games\Magnetic\Wonder\all.rdf Wonder.mag </body>
</pre>
 </body>
