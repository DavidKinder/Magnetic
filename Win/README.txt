
This is the source code for the Windows port of Niclas Karlsson's
Magnetic interpreter. To rebuild, you will need Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0
or newer, plus Microsoft Help Compiler 4.03. The later is available
from Microsoft's ftp site, ftp.microsoft.com (The version of the Help
Compiler included with VC 5.0 is not sufficient).
