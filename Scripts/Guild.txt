After script 1, you'll have to go into the one direction where
you don't die.
-> either check transcript for the "Enamelled on the surface..." reply
   or save + test all directions

This is (unfortunately) determined before the start of the game so 
the #seed value won't help. Then, use script 2 to finish the game.

(we *need* set random seed as command line option!!!)
